final variables -- Whose values never change once initialized 

1. In case of primitives, final says that value is constant. For example := 
    
    -- public static final double PI = 3.14;

2. But in case of reference types, reference is constant and not the object content

    -- public static final int[] PRIMES_TILL_7 = new int[] {2,3,5,7}; Then 
    
       PRIMES_TILL_7[2] = 90; (This is legal)
	     PRIMES_TILL_7 = new int[20]; (This is illegal)
       
       
3. final variables can be used with instance,local and static modifiers as well. 


4. final instance variables
	   -- constant for life of the object
	   -- MUST be initialized in
	   	  -- Declaration
	   	  -- Constructor
	      -- Instance initializer
        
    A final variable which is not initialized during declaration and initialized in ctro or II is called blank final.
        
5. final static variable
     -- these are independent of number of the instances of the class.
     -- They must be initialized in SI(static initializer) or initialized during declaration phase.
     -- NAMING CONVENTION 
        -- ALL CAPS WITH UNDERSCORE BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL WORDS
           For example := public static final int MAX_ROOMS_PER_HOUSE = 3;
