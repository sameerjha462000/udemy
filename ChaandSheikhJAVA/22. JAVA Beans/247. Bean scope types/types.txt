JAVA beans can have 4 types of scopes. These are

-- session
-- page
-- application
-- request


What is a session scope?

 -- In session scope, different bean is created for individual session. For example := When we are on chrome bean b1 would
    be created and when we are on firefox a different bean b2 would be created.


What is an application scope?

 -- In application scope, only a single bean would be created for all the sessions. So if a change is made during one session,
    then that would be reflected in other sessions as well.

What is a page scope?

 -- In page scope, changes made by a jsp to a bean would not be reflected on the other pages. For example := When we open 
    setPageProperty.jsp then the changes made by it would be limited to only this page and no change would be seen in getPageProperty.java.
