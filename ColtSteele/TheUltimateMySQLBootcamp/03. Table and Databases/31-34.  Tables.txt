1. How to create a table :
	
	first select the database in which you want to create a table. This could be done by the following command :
	(a)	CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
	
	Now after creating the database use the current database. For this we use the USE query:
	(b)	USE <database_name>;
	
	But how to know the current database :
	(c)	select database();

	Now create a table in the current database :
	(d)	CREATE TABLE <table_name>
  		(
    			<column_name> data_type,
    			<column_name> data_type
  		);


NOTE: It is a convention that table names be kept plural (as tables are collection of data).


2. How do we know that table has been created ?:

	(a)	SHOW TABLES;
		-- This query would show all the tables that are present in the current database.


3. How to see the columns in the table ?:

	SHOW COLUMNS FROM <table_name>;

	-- This query would show all the columns that are present int the current table.

	{OR MAYBE WE COULD ALSO USE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND}
	
	DESC <table_name>;

1. Let us say we want to create a whose name is "cats" inside the database "cat_app".
Ans: 
	CREATE DATABASE cat_app;
	USE cat_app;
	CREATE TABLE cats(name VARCHAR(100), age INT);

extra: Now to see the current table we have,
	
	SHOW TABLES;
	SHOW COLUMNS FROM cats; // DESC cats;
