1. We can also wire beans using the method of `method parameters`. For example, We can wire the `Person` bean to the `Vehicle` by passing the `Vehicle` as a parameter in the method used for creating the bean of `Person`.
2. When we mention something in the method parameters then the spring starts searching for a `bean` which returns an object of that class.
