1. The `@Autowired` annotation marks on a field, setter method, constructor is used to auto-wire the beans.
2. When we mark the `Vehicle` with `@Autowired` annotation, the Spring would search for it in the available beans and would wire it with the corresponding bean in the spring context.
3. This approach should not be used for `wiring` the beans as this is not `production friendly` since we cannot mark the fields as `final`.
